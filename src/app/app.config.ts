/**
 * Five providers, in the order spa-home documents. The third arrived with this application's first
 * page: `/platform-deployments/` now makes requests, and the fourth adds one more.
 *
 * - `provideBrowserGlobalErrorListeners` funnels genuinely-global errors and unhandled rejections
 *   into Angular's `ErrorHandler`.
 * - `provideRouter` carries the page's expansion in its query parameters, which is what makes one
 *   project's deployments bookmarkable.
 * - `withFetch` is not a preference. The default XHR backend is invisible to OTLP fetch
 *   instrumentation, so choosing it would quietly forfeit client spans the moment this deployment
 *   grows a telemetry relay. Every call this app makes is a same-origin path behind the gateway,
 *   which is what lets the browser's session cookie reach `/projects/api/…` from a page served at
 *   `/platform-deployments/` with no machine token and no CORS.
 * - `provideQitsNavigation` gives `QitsMainLayout` its left navigation, by asking the gateway for
 *   `/main-navigation` once at startup. The list is the gateway's answer now — derived from the
 *   routes it actually serves — not a list compiled into @qits/ui-components; without this provider
 *   the chrome renders no links at all. It needs the `provideHttpClient` above.
 * - `provideQitsProjects` puts the project picker in the chrome's top-left slot, where the wordmark
 *   was, from one `GET /projects/api/projects`. Every resource on this platform belongs to a
 *   project, so which one is open is the outermost fact about a page rather than a filter inside
 *   one of them — above the links, because it scopes them. It also installs the library's default
 *   scope, which carries a pick in `?project=` on the current URL; the pages here do not read that
 *   parameter yet, and the picker is the chrome's regardless of which of them have been scoped.
