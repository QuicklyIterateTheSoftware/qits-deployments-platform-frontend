/**
 * Three providers, in the order spa-home documents, and the third arrived with this application's
 * first page: `/cd/` now makes requests.
 *
 * - `provideBrowserGlobalErrorListeners` funnels genuinely-global errors and unhandled rejections
 *   into Angular's `ErrorHandler`.
 * - `provideRouter` carries the page's expansion in its query parameters, which is what makes one
 *   project's deployments bookmarkable.
 * - `withFetch` is not a preference. The default XHR backend is invisible to OTLP fetch
 *   instrumentation, so choosing it would quietly forfeit client spans the moment this deployment
 *   grows a telemetry relay. Every call this app makes is a same-origin path behind the gateway,
 *   which is what lets the browser's session cookie reach `/projects/api/…` from a page served at
 *   `/cd/` with no machine token and no CORS.
